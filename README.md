# Simulation of Boost PFC Using PLL

## Overview
This project presents the simulation of a Boost Power Factor Correction (PFC) converter using a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) in MATLAB/Simulink.

## Objectives
- Achieve near unity power factor
- Synchronize input voltage using PLL
- Implement current control for boost converter
- Analyze THD and dynamic response

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Control System Design

## Description
The PLL is used to extract the phase information of the input AC voltage. Based on the synchronized signal, the boost converter is controlled to shape the input current in phase with the input voltage, improving the power factor.
